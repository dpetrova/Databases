T-SQL (Transact-SQL) (sources: http://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/definition/T-SQL; http://tpostgres.org/se/tpg_what_is_tsql.jsp

T-SQL (Transact-SQL) is a set of programming extensions from Sybase and Microsoft that add several features to the Structured Query Language (SQL) including transaction control, exception and error handling, row processing, and declared variables. Microsoft's SQL Server and Sybase's SQL server support T-SQL statements.

T-SQL is the procedural programming language built into Sybase & SQL Server. It's functionally the equivalent of PostgreSQL's PL/pgSQL. It looks a bit odd because it has unique conventions like:
Semicolons are not required at the end of each line of code
 
Variable names always are prefixed with @ signs
 
IF statements do not need to be closed by END IF's
 
Temporary tables are automagic if the table name has a # prefix
