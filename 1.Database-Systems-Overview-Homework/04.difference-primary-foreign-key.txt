Problem 4.	Difference between a Primary and Foreign Key

Primary Key: 
  - identify uniquely every row; 
  - it can not be null; 
  - it can not be duplicate.

Foreign Key: 
  - create relationship between two tables;
  - can be null;
  - can be duplicate.

Primary key is a column of the table that uniquely identifies its rows (usually its is a number). Primary key allows each row in a table to be uniquely identified and ensures that no duplicate rows exist and no null values are entered.

Foreign key is an identifier of a record located in another table. Foreign Key (sometimes called a referencing key) is a key used to link two tables together. Typically you take the primary key field from one table and insert it into the other table where it becomes a foreign key (it remains a primary key in the original table).
