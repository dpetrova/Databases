Problem 3.	Define What is “Table” in Database Terms

In a relational database, a table (sometimes called a file) organizes the information about a single topic into rows and columns. For example, a database for a business would typically contain a table for customer information, which would store customers' account numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and so on as a series of columns. Each single piece of data (such as the account number) is a field in the table. A column consists of all the entries in a single field, such as the telephone numbers of all the customers. Fields, in turn, are organized as records, which are complete sets of information (such as the set of information about a particular customer), each of which comprises a row. The process of normalization determines how data will be most effectively organized into tables.

Tables vs. relations
In terms of the relational model of databases, a table can be considered a convenient representation of a relation, but the two are not strictly equivalent. For instance, an SQL table can potentially contain duplicate rows, whereas a true relation cannot contain duplicate tuples. Similarly, representation as a table implies a particular ordering to the rows and columns, whereas a relation is explicitly unordered. However, the database system does not guarantee any ordering of the rows unless an ORDER BY clause is specified in the SELECT statement that queries the table.
An equally valid representations of a relation is as an n-dimensional chart, where n is the number of attributes (a table's columns). For example, a relation with two attributes and three values can be represented as a table with two columns and three rows, or as a two-dimensional graph with three points. The table and graph representations are only equivalent if the ordering of rows is not significant, and the table has no duplicate rows.
